# Amplitude-Space-Edition
Amplitude (2003) has one extra song that was only released as a separate demo disk bundled in P.O.D.'s Album 'Payable on Death'.

This repo contains files that I used and modified to re-add the exclusive song into the main game.

For the .str files I used mfaudio to create them

They are Uncompressed PCM with 48000 hz frequency and 200 interleave

If you want to build your own disc you need [Onyx Command Line](https://github.com/mtolly/onyx/releases) to compile the configs to the format amp uses and arkhelper which is included in [Mackiloha](https://github.com/PikminGuts92/Mackiloha/releases) to extract and create .arks that amp also uses.

You are also going to need a copy of Amplitude (2003) and the Amplitude P.O.D demo.
